            <h1>History</h1>
            <h2>Beginnings and triumphs (1955–1989)</h2>
            <p>Al Nassr was established in 1955 by the Al-Ja’ba brothers. Training took place in an old playground at Gashlat Al-Shortah west of Al-Fotah Garden where there was a small football field and a small room to store balls and shirts. In addition to the Al-Ja'ba brothers, Ali and Al-Owais. Prince Abdul Rahman bin Saud Al Saud became the head of Al Nassr, he spent more than 39 years as the president for 3 stints till his death. His love of the team made him accept the challenge of being the president of a second division club and turning it to a champion and for that reason he is known as Al Nassr's Godfather. They were promoted to the first division in 1963. During the 1970s and 1980s, the club won four Saudi Premier League titles, six King's Cups, three Crown Prince Cups, and three Federation Cups. The team's success was built around the "Saudi Golden Trio" of Majed Abdullah, Fahd Al-Herafy and Mohaisn Al-Jam'aan.</p>

            <h2>The End of Abdul Majed Era (1989–2000)</h2>
            <p>In the 1990s, Al Nassr managed to win two further Saudi Premier League titles in 1993-1994 and 1994-1995 season, 1990 King's Cup and 1997-1998 Federation Cup. Towards the end of Majed Abdullah's career, he still wasn't able to lift the ultimate prize in UAFA region; the Arab Club Champions Cup while the other top clubs in Saudi already succeeded in doing this. Despite that, AFC Al Nassr managed triumph in the continental tournaments. 37 Years old striker Majed Abdullah at the time managed to win two GCC Club Cups, one Asian Cup Winners' Cup and one Asian Super Cup. Majed Abdullah announced his retirement on 12 April 1998 following Al-Nassr's win in the 1998 Asian Cup Winner's Cup against Suwon Samsung Bluewings from South Korea in front of 70,000 fans in Riyadh. Majed retired at 39 years old as the all-time top scorer of the Saudi League with 189 goals and is also Al-Nassr's all-time top scorer with 260 goals. A record that was considered untouchable until the coming of Abderrazak Hamdallah

                After becoming champion of Asian Super Cup, Al Nassr were eligible to represent the AFC region in the first FIFA Club World Cup Brazil 2000. In that championship Al Nassr played against Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, Real Madrid and Raja Casablanca, and finished 3rd in the group. Al Nassr won the competition's Fair Play award.</p>

            <h2>Slow Decline (2001–2007)</h2>
            <p>After the Golden Trio's retirement, Al Nassr's fresh squad at the time made an impressive performance during their first run in the FIFA Club World Cup. The Club then went on to sign some internationally recognized players, such as Ivory Coast's Fadel Keïta and former Barcelona Attacking Midfielder Julio César Baldivieso.

                Despite the expensive signings at the time, Al Nassr failed to keep their position in the league and soon got into some major setbacks. Things got worse as the next season went by. In 2006–07, the club only managed to avoid relegation on their last day of the season, which prompted honorary members including the legendary Majed Abdullah to intervene for the club. Their plan was to begin an effective long-term plan to restructure the new management.</p>

            <h2>Recent resurgence (2008–2015)</h2>
            <p>After a major overhaul of playing staff, Al Nassr went on to win the Federation Cup 2008 against city rivals, Al-Hilal. In the next season, Al Nassr made a record breaking transfer by signing young Al Sahlawi from Al Qadsiah in 2009 for SR32 million ($8 million) fee, breaking Yasser Al-Qahtani's record from Al Hilal from the same team as Sahlawi. Yasser record transfer are $2,5 million fee, he is also regarded as the best player in Asia defeating Nashat Akram and Younis Mahmoud whose national team clinching victory at 2007 Asian Cup.

                Newly reformed Al Nassr put lots of hope on their young striker's shoulders. In his first season with Al-Nassr, Al-Sahlawi scored 21 goals in 36 matches and received the Young Player of the Year award from STC. However, the club only finished third in 2009–10. Despite that, Al Nassr were elegible to secure a place in the Asian Champions League for the following season.</p>

            <h2>The Age of the 3 Strikers (2015–2022)</h2>
            <p>The 2010s marked the growth of football in most of Asian countries both in league quality and its national team. The AFC Champions League also started to spark interest among football enthusiasts worldwide.

                In the 2014–15 season, Al Nassr continued to defend their title as champions, by winning the league. However the team kept failing to get their treble after losing in the King's Cup final, as well as only reaching the Crown Prince's semi-final. Their hope of returning as champions they once were was still far under their grasp. Many fans felt let down by their club after losing in the group stage of the AFC Champions League against Bunyodkor from Uzbekistan, Al Duhail and Persepolis.
                
                Al Sahlawi, who was 27 years old at the time was only able to score 25 goals from his 37 appearance that season. For these reasons, the coach was replaced by the former Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita. Even with the Trickster training the team, Al Nassr still failed to break through the AFC Chanpions League. After being defeated by Al Duhail and Zob Ahan, Al Nassr finally defeated their opponent in which they lost to in the previous championship Bunyodkor back to back.
                
                The start of 2016-2017 season marked the transfers of two Croatian players into the club: Ivan Tomecak and Marin Tomasov, who were loaned to Al Nassr. Abdullah Madu, a new center-back at the time also started playing with the club. In this season however, the club only got 3rd position in Roshn Saudi League, behind their El Classico rival Al Ahli and city rival Al Hilal.
                
                In that season Al Nassr only achieved runner up in the Crown Prince Cup again defeated by Al Hilal. They were also runner up to Al Ahli in the final of Kings Cup. Al Nassr failed to qualify for the AFC Champions League 2017 and the AFC Champions League 2018. In 2015-2016 season, Sahlawi score 10 goals in his 29 appearance. In the season 2016-2017, Sahlawi only scored 11 goals in his 27 appearance and for the next season 12 goals from 24 appearance. Sahlawi score 33 goal in span of 3 years.
                
                Al Nassr coach Gustavo Quinteros from Bolivia, decided to sign Wingback Sultan Al Ghannam on 12 march 2018 for a free transfer from Al Faisaly. Ghannam quickly proved his talent by becoming a key player for in the defence and offence. The club also signed arguably the two best Moroccan Player's at the time, Abderrazek Hamdallah and Nordin Amrabat. Both of them joined in the Saudi Professional League on 16 July and 23 August 2018. Hamdallah once play for Aalesund FK in Norwegian League and Guangzhou R&F in Chinese League.
                
                The nicknamed executioner proved himself to be a menace when he made his debut against Al Qadsiah FC, making two assists. In his second match, he scored his first goal for the club against Al Taawoun FC. After this, Sahlawi's position as club favourite striker began to slowly shift into Hamdallah as the former Chinese League star player adapted with his teammates. By April 2019 Hamdallah had already scored 100 league goals even though he joined in Saudi League just one year prior. The Moroccan Forward broke the record since the league became professional in 2007 and carrying his team to qualify for 2019 AFC Champions League by defeating FK AGMK Olmaliq.
                
                In the 2019 AFC Champions League, Al Nassr managed to secure 2nd position just below Zob Ahan and advancing past the round of sixteen with Hamdallah scoring. In the quarter final, Al Nassr were defeated by Al Sadd 4-3. Hamdallah scored 4 goals in the 2019 AFC Champions League.
                
                Despite the bad start due to a previous ankle injury, Hamadallah was able to end his first season in the Saudi Professional League as the top scorer after impressively scoring 68 goals. By this time, Hamdalllah completely replaced Sahlawi as the main striker.
                
                In the 2018–19 Season he won the league title with his team. He scored a record of 34 goals with his teammate Nordin Amrabat. He scored in the final match against Al Batin. On 3 January 2019, Hamdallah scored his first hat-trick for the club against Al Jandal SC in Round of 64 in the 2019 King Cup.
                
                10 days later, he scored a super hat-trick against Al Ansar FC. He scored consecutive super hat-trick's against Al-Fayha FC in the Round of 16. On 27 April 2019, Hamdallah scored a double in a 4–2 loss in the semi-final against Al Ittihad of the 2019 King Cup. By the end of 2019, Hamdallah managed to beat several stars such as Robert Lewandowski and Lionel Messi as the world's top scorer after reaching 57 club goals. Al Sahlawi also left the club to join Al-Shabab.
                
                On 4 January 2020, Hamdallah scored in a 1–1 draw against Al Taawoun FC to win the 2019 Saudi Super Cup. On 30 January 2021, Hamdallah scored in a 3–0 victory against Al Hilal SFC to win the 2020 Saudi Super Cup.</p>

            <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo era (2023–present)</h2>
            <p>On 30 December 2022, Al Nassr signed Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portuguese player left Manchester United by mutual agreement. Ronaldo's contract runs for two-and-a-half years until summer 2025, with a total salary of €200 million per year, thought to be the highest ever paid to a professional footballer. He made an immediate impact on the global following of the club, with their Instagram account growing from 860,000 followers before his move to over 10 million followers less than a week later.[4] Al Nassr finished in second place in the 2022–23 season.

                Ronaldo's impact in Saudi Arabia helped the club sign players like Sadio Mané and Marcelo Brozović ahead of the 2023–24 season, and saw many other players like Neymar, Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kanté join the league.</p>

            <h1>Crest and colors</h1>
            <p>Al Nassr (Arabic: النصر) is the Arabic word for "victory", clubs with the same name are found in Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, and Libya but the Saudi Arabian club was the first to take the name.

                The club's logo represents the map of Arabia with yellow and blue colors. Yellow for the sand of the Arabian deserts and blue for the water in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula. Recently the old logo has been replaced by a "modernised" version, but still is heavily influenced by the old club logo. The new logo only represents the football team while the old logo represents the club as a whole.</p>
