<!-- Lab #2 Section -->
<section id="lab2" class="content-container">
    <h2>Lab 2</h2>
    <p>In Lab #2, I chose to recode a Wikipedia article about Alnassr FC using HTML5 semantic structure. The task involved using anchor links for navigation, downloading and optimizing images, and using CSS for visual hiding and improving legibility. A wrapper was also created to limit the line length to about 100 characters.</p>

<!-- Lab #3 Section -->
<section id="lab3" class="content-container">
    <h2>Lab 3</h2>
    <p>In Lab #3, I created a semantically structured HTML page about Cuisine Central. It included specific HTML5 elements, an accessible form, a data table, skip navigation, and Google fonts and material icons. The page was validated with various tools like HTML Validator, Wave, and Lighthouse.</p>

<!-- Lab #4 Section -->
<section id="lab4" class="content-container">
    <h2>Lab 4</h2>
    <p>Lab #4 involved creating a multicolumn layout for the Green Terrace Garden Caf√© website. This layout included a header, nav, main, asides, and footer, designed using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Media queries were used for responsiveness, and the navigation was made thumb-friendly for mobile devices.</p>
