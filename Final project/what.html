            <h2>What is Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal Design is the design of products, environments, and communication to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.</p>

            <img src="final2.png" alt="Illustration of the Principles of Universal Design">

            <h3>The Seven Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive:</strong> Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</strong> Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding these principles is key to implementing universal design in any field, especially in digital environments like web development.</p>
