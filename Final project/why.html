            <h2>Why Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal design in web development is not just a trend; it's an essential approach to creating websites and digital content that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. This inclusive design philosophy benefits not only individuals with disabilities but also offers enhanced usability for all users.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Accessibility in web design ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. By considering accessibility from the start, we can create more inclusive digital experiences.</p>

            <div class="accordion">
                <button class="accordion-button">Broadening Web Accessibility</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Universal design extends beyond mere compliance with legal standards. It involves creating web experiences that are inherently accessible to all users, including older individuals, people with temporary disabilities, and those using mobile devices.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Benefits for All</h3>
            <p>When websites are universally designed, they become more navigable, easier to understand, and overall more user-friendly. This not only benefits users with specific needs but enhances the experience for all visitors, potentially increasing reach and engagement.</p>
