                <li><strong>Planning for Accessibility:</strong> In the early stages of design, plan for accessibility. This includes choosing technologies and design approaches that support accessibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Semantic HTML:</strong> Write clean, semantic HTML to provide a solid foundation for accessibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensuring Keyboard Accessibility:</strong> Make sure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating Accessible Navigation:</strong> Design navigation that is easy to understand and use for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing for Accessibility:</strong> Regularly test your website with both automated tools and real users, including people with disabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Continuously seek feedback and make improvements to enhance accessibility and usability.</li>
